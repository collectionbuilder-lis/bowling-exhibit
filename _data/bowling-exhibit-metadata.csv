She is believed to be the first Nisei in the Rocky Mountain region and perhaps in the nation to be accepted in the national organization as a full-fledged member. The WIBC has a membership similar to the American Bowling Congress for men which has a strong “White Only” restriction. The Nisei placed her application through Sylvia Bem, secretary of the Denver WIBC office last month. Meanwhile, during the period when her membership was sent to national headquarters, it was expected that there would be some objection. Never-the-less, she received her offici-ally-sealed card without any statement regarding exclusion of non-Whites. The local office secretary is very sympathetic with Nisei and । wanted to see more Nisei become members in order to secure equality in bowling. Mrs. Mayeda bowled in a citysanctioned league recently and I made an excellent showing among the Hakujin wcwnen, it was learned. She is one of Denver most accurate and highest keglerette.

They called James Dorsey, prominent Negro attorney, who discussed the matter with alley proprietors and said later he would consult the district attorney’s office, The tournament is sponsored by the Milwaukee Sentinel.
